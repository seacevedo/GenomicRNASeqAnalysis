# The Role of ZBTB48 In Regulating Biological Aging

Aging is the continuous process of functional decay, which is a result of the atrophy of tissues and organs, as well as the cumulative damage to biomolecules such as DNA. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain why aging occurs in nature, but the most compelling is that aging is a consequence of the accumulation of DNA damage1. Therefore, the role of DNA repair is vital in curtailing the effects of senescence. The regulation of DNA repair enzymes could hold clues to the mechanisms involved in maintaining genomic stability and offsetting the consequences of aging. Of particular interest is the transcription factors involved in regulating the expression of genes involved in DNA damage repair, and how their ability to silence or enhance the expression of these genes could affect the aging process. The zinc-finger protein ZBTB48 is responsible for regulating telomere length but has also been shown to act as a transcription factor2. Due to its involvement in DNA maintenance and the well-known ability of zinc finger proteins to bind to DNA, we speculate that ZBTB48 also acts as a transcriptional regulator for DNA repair genes. Here we will use techniques such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to determine the effect ZBTB48 has on the expression of DNA repair enzymes and look for evidence of its ability to act as a transcription factor for proteins involved in DNA repair pathways.
